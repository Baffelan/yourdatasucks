# Welcome to Your Data Sucks

This is a work in progress space.

Our goal is helping to make your data less terrible.  
Trust us, we have seen some TERRIBLE data out there.  
It's not easy, there are no tricks, and no magic bullets.  
But together we can do it.

Having good data is a prerequisite to using all of the cool new toys that make a cutting edge business; LLMs, RAG, linear regression, etc.
Especially with the proliferation of black box AI, having robust data is the only way to know that what you are getting back is accurate and reliable.

Data pipelining, API integration, robust testing, we can help you with every step of this journey.
