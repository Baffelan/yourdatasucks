# Goal

This is going to be Baffelan vector for marketing.
The niche of market will be: "we'll work with you to make your data suck less, so you can use all the very fancy tech people talk about (_LLM_, _RAG_, _Linear Regression_, ...).

# building the website.

The website is _essentially_ a blog, a static html (+ a little js IF requested) is generated by [marmite](https://rochacbruno.github.io/marmite/) from a bunch of markdown files.

Simply as. For the moment we are deploying only on baffelan.github.io/yourdatasucks . We'll move to production domain when ready.

## See things change

Commit any change to the `marmite.yaml`, create `.md` files, or add some `css` customization, and see the Github Actions build the site and deploy for you.

You can customize `css` on `custom.css`, `JS` on `custom.js` and custom themes and other customization options are explained on [customization page](https://rochacbruno.github.io/marmite/tag/customization.html)

## To Build locally

If you are experimenting with hard to guess things and you need a branch for it (this is probably for things like css or js customization) you can build locally.

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:Baffelan/yourdatasucks.git
$ cd yourdatasucks
```

```console
$ cargo install marmite
```

```console
$ marmite . site
Site generated at: /site/
```
